Dolomite
=========

Dolomite is a Windows Azure based music storage and playback service

Why
-
- I got tired of Google <del>Music</del>Play having a copy of my music.
- I haven't found a music player that does exactly what I want, yet.
- I really like WCF and C# and want to do a project that uses it
- I'm intrigued by what all can be done with Windows Azure and wanted to explore the possibilities.
- For whatever reason, I need to prove I can write a RESTful interface. So why not use WCF? (yes, it **can** be done)
